Quiz me on $ARGUMENTS

## Quiz Structure (The Three Pillars)

### Round 1: Pattern Recognition (Pillar 1)
Test if I can identify the right approach:
- "Given [problem description], which pattern would you use and why?"
- "What's the key signal in this problem that hints at [pattern]?"
- "Name 2-3 other problems that use the same pattern"

### Round 2: Trade-off Analysis (Pillar 3)
Test if I understand complexity and alternatives:
- "What's the time/space complexity? Prove it."
- "How would you optimize if [constraint changed]?"
- "Compare approach A vs approach B for this problem"
- "What's the theoretical lower bound? Can we achieve it?"

### Round 3: Communication (Pillar 2)
Test if I can explain clearly (like in a real interview):
- "Explain your approach in 30 seconds as if I'm the interviewer"
- "Walk me through your solution with this input: [example]"
- "What edge cases would you test?"

### Round 4: Challenge My Assumptions
Push deeper understanding:
- "What would break if [condition]?"
- "Why doesn't [alternative approach] work here?"
- "If input size was 10^9, would your solution still work?"

## Quiz Rules
- Give me ONE question at a time
- Wait for my answer before revealing if correct
- If I'm wrong, don't just give the answer - ask a follow-up question to guide me
- After each answer, rate: ✅ Correct | ⚠️ Partially correct | ❌ Needs review
- At the end, summarize: "Areas strong: X, Y. Review needed: Z"

## Difficulty Scaling
- Start with conceptual questions
- Increase difficulty based on my answers
- End with a "FAANG-level" follow-up question
