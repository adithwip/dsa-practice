For the code I just wrote or am about to write, answer the fundamental questions:

## First Principles Analysis

### 1. Why This Approach?
- **What problem does this solve?** (The fundamental reason this algorithm exists)
- **What's the key insight?** (The "aha" moment that makes it work)
- **What pattern does this implement?** (Connect to the 26 essential patterns)

### 2. Why NOT Alternatives?

| Alternative | Why Not? | When It WOULD Be Better |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Brute force | [reason] | [scenario] |
| [Other pattern] | [reason] | [scenario] |
| [Other pattern] | [reason] | [scenario] |

### 3. Trade-off Analysis (The Third Pillar)
- **Time vs Space**: What did we trade and why?
- **Readability vs Performance**: Is clever code worth it here?
- **Optimality**: Are we at the theoretical lower bound? If not, why accept this?

### 4. What Would a Senior Engineer Do Differently?
- **Production considerations**: Error handling, edge cases, testing
- **Code style**: More Pythonic alternatives? Better variable names?
- **Architecture**: How would this fit in a larger system?

### 5. The 2025 AI Interview Lens
Since Meta and others now allow AI assistants in interviews:
- **Could AI generate this?** If yes, what value did YOU add?
- **Can you EXPLAIN why this works?** (This is what they're really testing)
- **Can you VALIDATE this is correct?** Walk through with example
- **Can you MODIFY if constraints change?** What if input was 10x larger?

## Output Format
```
Why this approach: [1-2 sentences]
Pattern used: [pattern name]
Trade-off made: [time/space decision]
Senior engineer would: [improvement suggestion]
Your value-add: [what you understand that AI doesn't]
```
