Give me a hint for: $ARGUMENTS

## Progressive Hint System (Reveal ONE level at a time)

Ask me "Ready for the next hint?" before proceeding to the next level.

### Level 1: Pattern Recognition (The First Pillar)
- **Problem category**: Which of the 26 patterns might apply?
- **Key signals in the problem**: What words/constraints hint at the pattern?
```
Pattern Heuristics:
- Sorted array? → Binary Search or Two Pointers
- Contiguous subarray? → Sliding Window
- All permutations/subsets? → Backtracking
- Tree traversal? → DFS or BFS
- Dependencies/ordering? → Topological Sort
- Connected components? → Union-Find or BFS/DFS
- Top/least K items? → Heap
- Overlapping subproblems? → Dynamic Programming
```

### Level 2: Key Insight (Abstraction)
- **The "aha" moment**: What's the core insight needed?
- **What makes this problem tractable?**: Why isn't brute force needed?
- **Similar problem**: "This is like [known problem] because..."

### Level 3: Approach (Decomposition)
- **High-level steps** without code
- **What data structures would help?** (hash map, heap, stack, etc.)
- **Edge cases to handle**: What inputs might break a naive approach?

### Level 4: Pseudocode (Algorithm Design)
- Only if explicitly requested after trying Level 3
- Language-agnostic steps
- Still NO actual Python code

## Important Rules
- **DO NOT give actual code** unless I explicitly say "show me the code"
- After each hint, ask: "What have you tried with this information?"
- If I'm going in the wrong direction, gently redirect with a question
- Use Socratic method: "What if the array was sorted? How would that change things?"
